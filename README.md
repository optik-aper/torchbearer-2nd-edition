# Torchbearer 2nd Edition 

A basic Foundry VTT system 

## System Objective

This is meant to be as simple of a system as possible... taking more effort to
emulate the Torchbearer 2nd Edition character sheet in its base form than to
automate every action or inventory management task.  Perhaps at some point this
will be amended to add some niceties but I'm more insterested in emulating the
basic sheet and allowing a simple skill/dice roller, leaving the upkeep to the
user to reduce complexity.
